## About the Reverse Polish Notation or simly the postfix notation
It is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands (3 4 +). It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. The description "Polish" refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz, who invented Polish notation in 1924.

The reverse Polish scheme was proposed in 1954 by Arthur Burks, Don Warren, and Jesse Wright and was independently reinvented by Friedrich L. Bauer and Edsger W. Dijkstra in the early 1960s to reduce computer memory access and use the stack to evaluate expressions.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Hewlett-Packard used RPN in all of their desktop and hand-held calculators, and continued to use it in some models into the 2020s. In computer science, reverse Polish notation is used in stack-oriented programming languages such as Forth, STOIC, PostScript, RPL and Joy.

Apart from the redundant use of parentheses, another asset of the calculator is the added precision. Internally it works with 200 digits after the comma and the final result is rounded up to 30 digits (this values can be easily adjusted to the needs of the individual user). This makes the calculator extremely useful for critical calculations (such as money operations).

## Some of the possible operations
* addition  `2 2 +`
* substitution  `2 1 -`
* division  `16 4 /`
* multiplication  `2 2 *` 
* factorial ! `5 !`
* the exponential function of a number `3 ^`
* the logarithmic function of a number ` 4 ln`
* exponentiation `3 exp`
* sqrt `2 sqrt`
* root `12 root`
* sin `e sin`
* cos `pi cos`
* tan `1E100 tan`
